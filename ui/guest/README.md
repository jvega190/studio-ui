# @craftercms/experience-builder

This package powers CrafterCMS's Experience Builder (XB) feature. With it, you can integrate your applications with XB to enable WYSIWYG editing and drag and drop in CrafterCMS.

The package provides both React-specific bindings and a generic API to interact with XB.

We recommend using an editor that supports TypeScript, such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA, to take advantage of the TypeScript typings provided by this package.
